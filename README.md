# memory-card-game
Overview:
We chose Memory Game as a topic for our CBL project. It's designed to help improve memory skills through an engaging card-matching game. 

Objectives:
  Create a simple and user-friendly interface.
  Include multiple levels that get progressively harder.
  Add fun audio and visual effects to enhance gameplay.
  Allow players to track their progress with a star rating system.

Features:
  Different levels with unique themes.
  Clear instructions to help players understand the game.
  A system to show completed levels and achievements.
  A congratulatory message when all levels are finished.

Technologies Used:
  Java for coding the game.
  Swing for the graphical user interface.
  Java Sound API for the audio features.
  




For the topics to explore, we chose to research more about UX design and GitHub.

Since this game is meant to be designed for children, user experience was an important topic for our project. We had to be careful that our game adheres to cognitive abilities, motor skills, attention span and emotional responses. We had to challenge ourselves with how to combine elements of education and entertainment, ensuring that the interface is intuitive, engaging, and understandable for young users. It was important to make the game fun to use, while also being useful for learning something. Here are the key design elements that we implemented to achieve that. 

Firstly, our game has a colorful and engaging interface. Since our target audience is children, we chose vibrant colors and friendly simplistic designs that are visually appealing to younger players. The core of the game revolves around matching images to their definitions, which introduces an educational element, but since the game style is “pixel art”, it makes our game “feel more like a game”, and less like a quiz on definitions. The game combines photos and definitions as we learned, through the archives of “UX Matters” (linked down below), that children learn better from a combination of text and image.
 The game is easy to navigate, thanks to our understandable buttons and a rule book, which explain the rules in a simple language. the interface uses large, easy-to-click cards and buttons to ensure that even the youngest players can navigate the game, since we have learned that it’s important to think about the motor and cognitive skills of children (Which we learned from the Ramotion blog on Ux design for kids).  This also aligns with best practices in UX design, which emphasizes simplicity and engagement, especially when designing for children.
Except visual elements, we wanted to add sound to our game. So, we also focused on researching  “sound design”, which  plays an important role in guiding the players. We implemented fun, positive sound effects to accompany interactions like flipping cards or completing levels. This adds an auditory cue to reinforce the actions, making the game more  engaging.

The game also includes a progress tracker, where players can see the levels they have completed. When a level is finished, a "congrats" screen appears to celebrate their success, providing positive reinforcement. This feature is important in child-friendly UX design, as it helps maintain motivation and rewards effort.
As our sources, we mostly used blog articles, design guidelines, videos and our own knowledge form previous education. Here’s a list of references which we used for this:

The second topic we explored was GitHub for collaborative development, specifically version control. It was critical for coordinating work between us. GitHub allowed us to manage the code efficiently and avoid conflicts when integrating our individual contributions. The main aspects that we focused on are sharing a repository, branching and merging, committing and reviewing.

We created a shared GitHub repository, where we both could push our changes. This repository acted as the central hub for our project, making it easy to track the latest version and revert any changes if necessary.

Each of us also made their own branch on which we worked on, so that we do not disturb each other’s code.  Marharyta focused on working on the main menu, congratulation screen and the look of user interface, while Elizaveta worked more on the card and game logic. Once our individual tasks were completed, we committed the changes and created pull requests to merge the branches back into the master branch.

We made sure to regularly commit our progress with clear messages, detailing the updates or fixes we implemented. This helped both of us understand the flow of the project, so we were never confused on which stage our project was on. On top of that, we reviewed each other's code to ensure there were no issues before merging branches.

For the resources on GitHub, we mostly relied on GitHub’s official documentation. It provided clear instructions on how to navigate it. https://docs.github.com/en
Other than that, we used articles from various sites:
